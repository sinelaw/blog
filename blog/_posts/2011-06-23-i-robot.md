So what? I've graduated (actually almost a year ago).

You can see the presentation I gave for my project: \[googleapps domain="docs" dir="present/embed" query="id=dgc77gfh\_27g5tb89z5" width="410" height="342" /\]

Here is the [robot from my project](http://noamlewis.wordpress.com/2010/06/03/haskell-controlled-segway-robot/ "Haskell-controlled SegwayÂ robot"):
