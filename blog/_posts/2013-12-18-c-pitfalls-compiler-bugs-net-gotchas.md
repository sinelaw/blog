[C# Pitfalls, Compiler Bugs & .NET gotchas](https://github.com/bdb-opensource/c-sharp-pitfalls "C# Pitfalls, Compiler Bugs & .NET gotchas")

Rarely, but not rarely enough, I find myself banging my head against some unexpected semantics of the C# language. Sometimes I'm simply misunderstanding the language, other times it's a limitation, or even a compiler bug.

To document my findings I've started [repository on github](https://github.com/bdb-opensource/c-sharp-pitfalls) for a list of C# pitfalls, compiler bugs, and various other .NET framework gotchas. These are not "beginner tips" - they are things that may surprise a seasoned developer (or is it just me?).

In any case, all are welcome to join this effort - don't hesitate to fork & send your pull requests.
