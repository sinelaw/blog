I spend too much time in traffic.

So much time, that I start to see things. I see patterns.

You can get stuck in a slow lane because the others are going so fast you never manage to merge. So on average, how much time do you spend stuck in unescapable lanes? Does it make a difference in the cosmic scheme? (No, it doesn't)

I decided to build a simulator and see how driving styles affect traffic.
