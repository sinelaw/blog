I knew a new name is needed for [this JS type inferer/checker](https://noamlewis.wordpress.com/2015/01/20/introducing-sjs-a-type-inferer-and-checker-for-javascript/). Many people have pointed out that sweet.js uses the same short name (sjs). I could just stick with "Safe JS" but not make it short. Or I could pick a new name, to make it less boring.

Help me help you!
